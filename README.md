## Description

<br>

Virtuoso is an aspiring online education platform built with a focus on improving the experience and efficacy of webinars as an educational forum.

We put our content creator (aka "Virtuoso") in the spotlight by making it easy for them to create, organize, and share their content in a way that fits their workflow and vision.

We enable our content consumer (aka "Prodigy") by making it easy for them to access and find the right content, without hassle. Out prodigies have the advantage being aided by our adaptive assessments, curated learning paths, courses authored by top industry experts, and on-demand usage statistics and reports.

Virtuoso is simply the stage. It's our community that makes for a symphony. [Hear with your eyes.](https://brokenhoax.github.io/Prodigy-Frontend/#/register)
